\problemname{Beach}
\noindent
Maja is tired of the coast being taken up by large seaside plots and instead wants to create a long, beautiful beach for public use.
She is now planning to buy a segment of plots along the coast to create the beach.

Maja has a budget of $B$ kronor, and the plots along the coast cost $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$ kr from left to right.
What is the longest segment of plots that Maja can afford to buy?

\section*{Input}
The first line contains two integers $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$), the number of plots, and $B$ ($0 \leq B \leq 10^9$), Maja's budget.

The second line contains the $N$ integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$ ($1 \le A_i \le 1,000$), where $A_i$ is the price of plot $i$.

\section*{Output}
Print a single integer: the largest number of consecutive plots Maja can afford to buy.

\section*{Points}
Your solution will be tested on several test case groups.
To get the points for a group, it must pass all the test cases in the group.

  \hline
  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Point value} & \textbf{Constraints} \\ \hline
  $1$   & $20$       & $N \leq 500 $ and all $A_i$ has the same value.\\ \hline
  $2$   & $30$       & $N \leq 500 $\\ \hline
  $3$   & $50$       & No additional constraints. \\ \hline
