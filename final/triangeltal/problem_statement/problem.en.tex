\noindent
In a class with $N$ students, it is time for the obligatory task of giving a speech.
Most students are very excited to give their speeches and can hardly wait for their turn.
First, they must be divided into three groups. Everyone in group $1$ will then present to group $2$,
group $2$ to group $3$, and group $3$ to group $1$.

One complication in this grouping is that the students have different ambition levels. Each student $i$
requires to give their speech to at least $A_i$ people.
So, if student $i$ ends up in group $1$, group $2$ must have at least $A_i$ members for student $i$ to be satisfied.

Your task is to determine, given the students' ambition levels, if there is a way to divide the students into three groups so that everyone is satisfied, and if so, find a valid division.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains an integer $N$ ($3 \leq N \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$), the number of students in the class.

The second line contains $N$ integers $A_i$ ($1 \leq A_i \leq N$), where $A_i$ is the minimum number of students the $i$-th student wants to give a speech to.

\section*{Output}
If there is no valid division, print a single line with the string ``\texttt{NO}''.

If there is a valid division, first print a line with the string ``\texttt{YES}''.
Then, print a line with a string $S$ consisting of the characters \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, and \texttt{3}.
The character at position $i$ in this string indicates which group student $i$ belongs to. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains
a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
