\problemname{Fiber Optics}
\noindent
The communication network in Stackk√∂ping consists of a tree with $N$ nodes. You want to select certain edges and place fiber optic cables there. However, each node can have at most $K$ edges with fiber optic cables connected to it.

Your task is to place as many fiber optic cables as possible. But each edge also has a cost, and among all the ways to place the maximum number of fiber optic cables, you want to find the one with the minimum possible cost.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq K \leq 100$).

The following $N-1$ lines each contain two integers $p_i$, $w_i$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq i$, $0 \leq w_i \leq 10^9$).
This means that there is an edge between the nodes with indices $p_i$ and $i+1$, with a cost $w_i$.

\section*{Output}
Print two integers: the maximum number of edges, and the minimum cost for that number of edges.

\section*{Points}
Your solution will be tested on several test case groups.
To get the points for a group, it must pass all the test cases in the group.
